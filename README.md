# AnonymizeNLP

Anonymize-NLP is a lightweight and robust package for text anonymization. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Regular Expressions (Regex) to identify and mask sensitive information in a string.

## Features

- Anonymize specific categories in a text, including emails, monetary values, organizations, people, and phone numbers and more.
- Customizable anonymization: Specify which categories to anonymize and which to exclude.
- De-anonymization: Revert anonymized text back to its original form.
- Built-in compatibility with nlp NER - compromise.

## Installation

Install Anonymize-NLP and its peer dependencies with npm.

```bash
npm i anonymize-nlp
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { AnonymizeNlp } from 'anonymizenlp';

const anonymizer = new AnonymizeNlp();
const anonymizedText = anonymizer.anonymize(`Hi i'm John Doe, my email is john@example.com and my phone number is +1-234-567-8900.`);

console.log(anonymizedText);
// Output: "Hi i'm <FIRSTNAME> <LASTNAME>, my email is <EMAIL> and my phone number is <PHONENUMBER>."

const originalText = anonymizer.deAnonymize(anonymizedText);
console.log(originalText);
// Output: "Hi i'm John Doe, my email is john@example.com and my phone number is +1-234-567-8900."
```
